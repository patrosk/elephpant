        <article class="definition">A monster is usually defined as a large, frightening and evil imaginary creature. It often implies
            a repulsive character, an object of dread, awful deeds or abomination. Monsters are often depicted as inherently evil beings that
            are dangerous and aggressive and have a grotesque and abnormal appearance that inspires terror and fear. Most monsters share some
            similarities with animals or humans, but are hideously deformed in one way or another. They often herald destruction and death and
            threaten the moral or social order of human existence.
