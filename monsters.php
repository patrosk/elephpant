        This made Athena furious. But not with Poseidon - she unleashed her wrath upon Medusa and cursed her. The woman was transformed
        into a monster with snakes as hair, so that no man could ever look at her with desire. Her gaze turned
        men into stone. Shunned by everyone, she hid in the cavernous Sarpedon. The 'hero' Perseus slayed her with
        the help of Athena, who gave him a reflective shield with which he could see Medusa without risking to meet
        her petrifying gaze. He severed her head from her body and used it to petrify his enemies. I don't know about
        you, but I think the villain of this story could hardly be Medusa.",
