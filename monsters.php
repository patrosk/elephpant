        'story' => "Poseidon was bewitched by the beauty of the woman Medusa. When she didn't accept his advances, he raped her in the temple of Athena.
        This made Athena furious. But not with Poseidon - she unleashed her wrath upon Medusa and cursed her. The woman was transformed
        into a monster with snakes as hair, so that no man could ever look at her with desire. Her gaze turned
        men into stone. Shunned by everyone, she hid in the cavernous Sarpedon. The hero Perseus was sent to kill her in order to prove himself. He slayed her with
        the help of Athena, who gave him a reflective shield with which he could see Medusa without risking to meet
        her petrifying gaze. He severed her head from her body and thereafter used it to petrify his enemies. Upon completing his mission and receiving his reward,
        Perseus gifted Medusa's head to Athena who put it in her shield, thereby creating a powerful weapon.
        Although described as a hideous monster, Medusa was ultimately a victim of the gods' lust and anger. Making her pay for
        Poseidon's crime is, I'd say, more than questionable. To make matters worse, she was hunted down and killed in order
        for a hero to gain recognition. Victim-blaiming much??",

        'slain_by' => 'Theseus',

        'story' => "Angry that the king didn't sacrifice a bull to Poseidon as intended, the Sea God made the king's
        wife fall in love with the snow-white bull. The result of this love was Minotaur, a creature with the body of
        a man and the head and tail of a bull. Since there was no natural source of nourishment, Minotaur started eating
        humans to stay alive. Fearing the man-eating beast, the king commissioned a huge labyrinth, in which Minotaur was
        trapped. To keep the beast in check, fourteen youths were sacrificed at regular intervals.
        The youths were sent into the labyrinth to be hunted down and devoured by Minotaur. The hero Theseus volunteered
        to join the third batch of youths to be sacrificed to kill the monster. He was aided by the king's daughter who fell in
        love with him; she gave him a ball of yarn which allowed him to retrace his stepts and navigate in the labyrinth.
        He managed to kill the Minotaur and led the youths out of the labyrinth. On his way back home, he left the king's
        daughter on an island and neglected to put up the white sails he had promised in case of a succesful mission. His father
        saw his ship approaching and, presuming his son to be dead, committed suicide. This secured the throne for Theseus. Minotaur
        is depicted as a ferocious monster, but it could also be argued that he was merely the result of a cruel joke by
        Poseidon. Trapping a beast in a labyrinth and then sending youths to be sacrificed or to kill it is also, I'd say,
        in the gray area of morality.",

        'story' => "The many-headed serpent Hydra was created by the goddess Hera to kill the hero Hercules. Hydra dwelled in
        a cave said to be one of the entrances to the Underworld, thus hindering mortals to enter the realm of the dead. Not
        fearing the monster, Hercules beheaded Hydra; however, it regrew two heads for every head severed. Hercules found
        himself fighting with an increasingly powerful creature, and it was only with the help of his nephew that he realised he
        could defeat it by scorching the neck stumps after decapitation, thus preventing new heads from growing. In this manner,
        he finally defeated Hydra. The one immortal head of Hydra was cut off with a golden sword and put under a stone. Hercules
        then dipped his arrows in Hydra's venomous blood and used it to kill his coming enemies. Hera, upset that Hydra didn't kill Hercules,
        placed Hydra in the sky, thus creating the constellation Hydra. Like many monsters in Greek Mythology, Hydra was placed in
        a hero's way way to fame. His success required the monster's defeat. Although Hydra is not described as a particularly developed
        creature, being killed by slowly having all your heads cut off and your neck stumps scorched doesn't sound like a nice way to go.
        And Hydra was just doing as it was told, right?",

        his own business herding sheep. Cyclopes were sometimes described as man-eating savages and sometimes as skilled musicians. When
        Odysseus and his men came upon Polyphemus, they were trapped by the cyclope in his cave. Each morning, Polyphemus left the cave to graze
        his sheep and every evening as he returned, he ate two of the men. In order to escape, Odysseus managed to get Polyphemus drunk one
        evening. As the giant dozed off, Odysseus took a sharp wooden stake and drove it into Polyphemus' only eye. The cyclope cries out in
        anguish but receives no help. When he lets the sheep out of the cave in the morning, he feels their backs to ensure the men are not
        escaping on them; however, Odysseus and his crew had tied themselves to the sheep's bellies and thus escaped the cave and left the
        island. It is understandable that Odysseus felt compelled to contrive a plan to escape after seeing two men of his crew being devoured
        every night, but I cannot help feeling for Polyphemus losing his only eye.",
