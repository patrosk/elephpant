            "Perspehone was the beautiful daughter of Demeter, the goddess of harvest, grain, fertility
    and all living plants. One day, while she was picking flowers on the fields of Sicily,
    Hades, the god of the Underworld, appeared in his chariot and kidnapped her. He took her to
    the Underworld where she was kept prisoner for several years. Her mother Demeter was devastated that
    her daughter had disappeared, and spent years searching for her. She was so busy with worrying about
    her daughter, that she forgot about her duties as goddess - the earth dried out, harvests were bad, entire
    fields of grain rotted.",

            "The people of Greece were starving. Finally, Demeter found out where her daughter
    had been taken. She demanded that Hades return her, and he agreed but for one condition: Persephone must
    have spent her time in the Underworld without touching any of the food there. The food in the Underworld is
    the food of the dead, and whoever eats it must spend eternity there. Perspehone said she had never touched
    the food she was returned to her mother. Demeter was so happy that all plants quickened, fields
    were filled with grain and sweet fruits hung from the trees. Hades was furious, he wanted Persephone as his queen.
    He interrogated every soul in the Underworld until he found one who testified that Perspehone, in her desperation
    to quench her thirst, had eaten seven seeds of a pomegranate.",

            "Triumphant, Hades demanded the return of Persephone.
    Realising there was no other way out, Demeter agreed to part from her daughter, but threatened to neglect her
    duties as a goddess. A compromise was reached: Persephone would spend nine months on Earth with her mother,
    and three months in the Underworld. When she was with her mother, nature was blessed with life, the soil was rich
    and harvests were plentiful. When she left for the Underworld, the trees lost their leaves, plants withered and the
    earth froze. Nature was lifeless, until Persephone's return. When she left the Underworld, she brought spring with her.
    This is how the seasons were created."

            "After overthrowing the cruel titans and instating himself and his siblings as the new gods, Zeus was
        the most powerful god on Mount Olympus. He could pretty much do as he pleased, although the other gods sometimes
        not only questioned him but also actively worked against him.",

            "He was the one to create humankind; the first humans lived
        worry-free lives in sunshine and happiness until they died of old age. Next, Zeus created humans who unfortunately turned
        out to ignore the gods completely. They were arrogant and complacent and constatntly arguing with each other, which
        eventually made Zeus exterminate them all. Zeus created another batch of humans - these were smarter and gifted but
        instead of using it for good, they spent all their time and capacities to design and manufacture weapons, with which
        they then used to kill each other. Eventually, all of them were dead and spent eternity in the Underworld. Zeus made one
        last attempt at creating humans and this time, he was succesful. He created the Age of Heroes, with numerous extraordinary
        humans that would come to be praised in the ages to come.",

            "Like the other gods on Olympus, one of Zeus' favourite past-times
        was visiting the mortal humans. His object was often to help those in need, but his meddling did not always end up
        improving the humans' lives. Zeus and his wife Hera were an odd couple, almost constantly bickering and arguing. One constant
        source of quarrel was Zeus permanent infidelity. Many are the stories where he visits beautiful mortal women, courts them, and if
        they aren't charmed by him, he transforms himself into various creatures to win them over. To gain Hera's affection,
        he once turned himself into a sickly cuckoo, which she nursed back to health. Other animals ornatural phenomena he transformed himself into, and often
        engaged in sexual activities with women, include a swan, an eagle, a shower of gold, a flame of fire, a bull, an ant, a bear, a goose,
        a serpent, a vulture and a satyr (male nature spirit with the body of a man but the ears and tail of a horse and a permanent
        erection), among others. Those who he could not seduce in these forms, he abducted and/or raped. He also transformed himself on numerous occassions to other people in order to seduce women. For example,
        Alcmene slept with Zeus while he was disguised as her husband, and he pulled the same trick on Cassiopeia. Calling Zeus a sex addict
        is maybe unfair - a more fitting adjective would be 'enourmus asshole'."

            "Helen of Troy was said to be the most beautiful woman in the world. She was the daughter of the Spartan queen Leda
            and Zeus (he had transformed himself into a swan to seduce her; Leda then lay two eggs, from which Helen and her siblings sprung).
            Already from a young age, Helen was deemed incredibly beautiful, and some myths even include her being abducted by Theseus as a youth.
            When Helen was old enough to marry, kings and princes from all over the world came offering gifts for her hand in marriage. The king did
            not want to send the suitors away in fear of upsetting them and provoking animosity and possibly war. It was eventually settled that
            all suitors must swear an oath to defend the husband of Helen if anyone should ever attack or provoke him. At last, Menelaus was
            chosen to wed Helen and the pair became king and queen of Sparta.",

            "Trojan prince Paris came to Sparta on a supposed diplomatic
            mission - in reality, he had come to claim Helen. Paris had been ordered by Zeus to appoint the most beautiful of the goddesses Hera,
            Aphrodite and Athena. Paris chose Aphrodite after she promised him the world's most beautiful woman. Paris and Helen fell in love and she fled her unhappy marriage to Menelaus and escaped with Paris to Troy. Furious, Menelaus called on all
            the other suitors to fulfil their oath, thus starting the Trojan War.",

            "A delegation was dispatched where Odysseus tried to convince
            the Trojan king Priam to hand Helen back. He refused. The war began and Troy was under siege; Helen was filled with self-loathing
            and regret for what her escape had caused. The war was a bloodbath and at its end, The Trojans hated Helen. Hector, the oldest son of Priam and Troy's
            greatest warrior was killed by Achilles, and Paris was eventually killed in combat. The Greeks entered Troy in the wooden horse and sacked
            the city. Troy was burning and Helen could not find sanctuary anywhere; both Trojans and Greeks were ready to stone her to death. When
            Menelaus found her, he raised his sword to kill her, but then she dropped her robes to the ground and thus revealed her naked body.
            The sight of her beauty made Menelaus drop his sword. Helen returned to Sparta with Menelaus. A tragic end to a tragic story, mostly fuelled
            by men's desire to control or gain the affections of a beautiful woman.",

            "Zeus may have taken credit for creating mankind, but he only managed with the help of the titan Prometheus. Prometheus
            was wise and kind and saw the potential of the humans - he wanted to teach them all he could. Zeus was afraid that if they knew too much, humans could pose
            a threat to the gods on Olympus. Therefore, he forbade Prometheus to teach the mortals how to make fire; without that, Zeus
            deemed it impossible for them to pose a real threat. But Prometheus already loved the humans and went behind Zeus' back and
            showed the humans how to make fire. The humans developed rapidly - from being primitive and helpless, they quickly became skilled
            craftsmen, farmers and architects. When Zeus found out about Prometheus' betrayal, he was furios. He chained the titan to a rock
            and condemned him to each day have his liver pecked out by an eagle. By the next day, the liver was again intact and the torture
            could start over.",

            "But Zeus was not content with punishing Prometheus alone, he also wanted to exact revenge on the humans. With the help of the other
            gods, Zeus created and educated a beautiful woman, Pandora. When her training was complete, she was presented before Zeus and he
            gave her a beautiful shrine which she could take with her wherever she went, but never could open. A husband was selected for Pandora
            and upon receiving the same warning about the shrine, he locked it away. Pandora could not, though she tried, contain her curiosity.
            One night she stole her husband's key and unlocked the cabinet where the shrine was kept.",

            "She hesitated, but then opened the box. Expecting jewelry, gemstones, gold and treasures, Pandora was terrified when the box unleashed
            a strong wind and with it all evil to ever afflict mankind - harsdship, poverty, aging, disease, jealousy, suffering and despair.
            Pandora tried desperately to close the box but it was too late. The evils had already spread all over the world, and Zeus exacted his revenge
            on the humans. Instead of becoming a perpetually blessed and prospering people, humans were now condemned to struggle endlessly
            with brutality and oppression. But Zeus did not succeed fully; Pandora looked into the shrine and found one object still in it and
            immediately shut the lid and locked the box. Thus, she saved hope from perishing. Even in this new, hostile world, humans would prevail
            and find a way, because they still had hope.",
