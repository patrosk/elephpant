            "Perspehone was the beautiful daughter of Demeter, the goddess of harvest, grain, fertility
    and all living plants. One day, while she was picking flowers on the fields of Sicily,
    Hades, the god of the Underworld, appeared in his chariot and kidnapped her. He took her to
    the Underworld where she was kept prisoner for several years. Her mother Demeter was devastated that
    her daughter had disappeared, and spent years searching for her. She was so busy with worrying about
    her daughter, that she forgot about her duties as goddess - the earth dried out, harvests were bad, entire
    fields of grain rotted.",

            "The people of Greece were starving. Finally, Demeter found out where her daughter
    had been taken. She demanded that Hades return her, and he agreed but for one condition: Persephone must
    have spent her time in the Underworld without touching any of the food there. The food in the Underworld is
    the food of the dead, and whoever eats it must spend eternity there. Perspehone said she had never touched
    the food she was returned to her mother. Demeter was so happy that all plants quickened, fields
    were filled with grain and sweet fruits hung from the trees. Hades was furious, he wanted Persephone as his queen.
    He interrogated every soul in the Underworld until he found one who testified that Perspehone, in her desperation
    to quench her thirst, had eaten seven seeds of a pomegranate.",

            "Triumphant, Hades demanded the return of Persephone.
    Realising there was no other way out, Demeter agreed to part from her daughter, but threatened to neglect her
    duties as a goddess. A compromise was reached: Persephone would spend nine months on Earth with her mother,
    and three months in the Underworld. When she was with her mother, nature was blessed with life, the soil was rich
    and harvests were plentiful. When she left for the Underworld, the trees lost their leaves, plants withered and the
    earth froze. Nature was lifeless, until Persephone's return. When she left the Underworld, she brought spring with her.
    This is how the seasons were created."

            "After overthrowing the cruel titans and instating himself and his siblings as the new gods, Zeus was
        the most powerful god on Mount Olympus. He could pretty much do as he pleased, although the other gods sometimes
        not only questioned him but also actively worked against him.",

            "He was the one to create humankind; the first humans lived
        worry-free lives in sunshine and happiness until they died of old age. Next, Zeus created humans who unfortunately turned
        out to ignore the gods completely. They were arrogant and complacent and constatntly arguing with each other, which
        eventually made Zeus exterminate them all. Zeus created another batch of humans - these were smarter and gifted but
        instead of using it for good, they spent all their time and capacities to design and manufacture weapons, with which
        they then used to kill each other. Eventually, all of them were dead and spent eternity in the Underworld. Zeus made one
        last attempt at creating humans and this time, he was succesful. He created the Age of Heroes, with numerous extraordinary
        humans that would come to be praised in the ages to come.",

            "Like the other gods on Olympus, one of Zeus' favourite past-times
        was visiting the mortal humans. His object was often to help those in need, but his meddling did not always end up
        improving the humans' lives. Zeus and his wife Hera were an odd couple, almost constantly bickering and arguing. One constant
        source of quarrel was Zeus permanent infidelity. Many are the stories where he visits beautiful mortal women, courts them, and if
        they aren't charmed by him, he transforms himself into various creatures to win them over. To gain Hera's affection,
        he once turned himself into a sickly cuckoo, which she nursed back to health. Other animals ornatural phenomena he transformed himself into, and often
        engaged in sexual activities with women, include a swan, an eagle, a shower of gold, a flame of fire, a bull, an ant, a bear, a goose,
        a serpent, a vulture and a satyr (male nature spirit with the body of a male but the ears and tail of a horse and an enlarged, permanent
        erection), among others. Those who he could not seduce in these forms, he abducted and/or raped. He also transformed himself on numerous occassions to other people in order to seduce women. For example,
        Alcmene slept with Zeus while he was disguised as her husband, and he pulled the same trick on Cassiopeia. Calling Zeus a sex addict
        is maybe unfair - a more fitting adjective would be 'enourmus asshole'."
